How to run:
	1. Navigate to executable directory via command prompt.
	2. See below for usage.

Usage examples:
	Hide:	
		$ DCTSwap2.exe -i [cover fileName] -h [message file] 
	optionally set hide level:
		$ DCTSwap2.exe -i [cover fileName] -h [message file] -l [hiding level]

	Extract:
		$ DCTSwap2.exe -i [cover fileName] -e
	optionally set hide level:
		$ DCTSwap2.exe -i [cover fileName] -e -l [hiding level]

	NOTE:	The extraction needs to have the same hiding level as the hide used.
		By default, it's set to 20.

	Hiding level range: 1-32

About the extraction process:

	Currently the code ours is built upon embeds some null bytes in the beginning of the 
	message buffer along with the file name. The extraction does not handle this. Because 
	of this, it is recommended you use .txt files to hide in order to verify the 
	extraction process works correctly.

	To further justify this, the length of the message was not inserted into the hiding
	code, so the extraction process will continue to extact indiscriminately until the 
	end of file. Thus, if the entire capacity was not utilized, garbage will be appended
	to the end of the extracted file.
